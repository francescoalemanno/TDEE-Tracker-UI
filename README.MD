A modern, easy-to-use web application for tracking your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) and managing weight goals.

## üìã Overview

TDEE Tracker UI helps you:

- Log your daily weight and caloric intake
- Track your TDEE (how many calories your body burns) using advanced statistical methods
- Visualize weight and TDEE trends over time
- Receive personalized advice for reaching your weight goals

This tool is perfect for fitness enthusiasts, dieters, or anyone interested in understanding their metabolism better.

## üåü Features

- **Simple Daily Logging**: Easy interface to enter your weight and calorie intake
- **Advanced Calculations**: Uses Kalman filtering to accurately estimate your TDEE
- **Visual Trends**: See how your TDEE and weight change over time with intuitive charts
- **Goal Setting**: Enter your target weight and get daily calorie recommendations
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust calculation settings based on your specific needs
- **Local Storage**: Your data stays on your computer, no cloud account needed
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Version 1.3.0**: Now with improved statistical modeling for better accuracy

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation Options

#### 1. Download Pre-built Binary (Easiest)

Download the latest release for your operating system from the [Releases page](https://github.com/francescoalemanno/TDEE-Tracker-UI/releases).

#### 2. Build from Source

If you have Go installed, you can build from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/francescoalemanno/TDEE-Tracker-UI.git
cd TDEE-Tracker-UI

# Build the application
go build .

# Run the application
./TDEE-Tracker-UI  # on Linux/macOS
TDEE-Tracker-UI.exe  # on Windows
```

### Command-line Options

You can customize how the application runs using these flags:

```
TDEE Tracker - Track your TDEE and weight

Usage:
  -logs string
        Path to logs CSV file (overrides TDEE_LOGS_FILE env variable)
  -no-browser
        Don't automatically open browser
  -params string
        Path to parameters JSON file (overrides TDEE_PARAMS_FILE env variable)
  -port int
        Port to serve application on (default 8080)

Environment variables:
  TDEE_LOGS_FILE    Path to logs CSV file
  TDEE_PARAMS_FILE  Path to parameters JSON file
```

### First Time Setup

1. Launch the application - it will automatically open in your default web browser
2. Go to the Settings page (‚öôÔ∏è icon) to set your goal weight
3. Start logging your daily weight and calories consumed

## üìä How It Works

TDEE Tracker uses a Kalman filter algorithm to estimate your true TDEE based on your logged weight and calorie intake. The mathematical model accounts for:

- Daily metabolic variations
- Measurement errors in calorie counting
- Fluctuations in body weight measurements
- The relationship between calorie deficit/surplus and weight change

The Kalman filter is a state estimation algorithm that provides optimal estimates by combining predictions with measurements, considering their respective uncertainties. This approach offers more accurate and stable TDEE estimations compared to simpler methods.

For optimal results:

- Log your weight and calories consistently (daily is best)
- Be as accurate as possible with calorie counting
- Give the model at least 2-3 weeks of data for accurate TDEE estimation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

In the Settings page, you can customize:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Initial TDEE | Starting estimate for your TDEE | -1 (uses first entry's calories) |
| Calories per Fat Kg | Energy stored in 1kg of body fat | 7700 kcal/kg |
| RSD TDEE | Day-to-day variation in metabolism | 0.01 |
| RSD Obs Cal | Accuracy of calorie counting | 0.1 |
| RSD Obs Weight | Accuracy of weight measurement | 0.005 |
| RSD Weight | Random daily variation in true weight | 0.001 |
| PF Variance Boost | Kalman filter variance scaling | 0.333 |
| Goal Weight | Your target weight in kg | -1 (disabled) |

## üìÅ Data Storage

Your data is stored in the following locations:

- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\tdee-tracker\`
- **macOS**: `$HOME/.config/tdee-tracker/`
- **Linux**: `$HOME/.config/tdee-tracker/`

You can override the storage location using environment variables or command-line flags:
- `TDEE_LOGS_FILE` or `-logs`: Path to the CSV file for your logs
- `TDEE_PARAMS_FILE` or `-params`: Path to the JSON file for your settings

## üîÑ Upgrading

When upgrading to a newer version:

1. Back up your logs.csv and params.json files
2. Install the new version
3. If needed, specify the path to your existing files using the command-line flags
